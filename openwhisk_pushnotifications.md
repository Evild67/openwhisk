# Using the Push Notifications package
{: #openwhisk_catalog_pushnotifications}

The `/whisk.system/pushnotifications` package provides you with the ability to work with a push service.
{: shortdesc}

The package includes the following action and feed:

| Entity | Type | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/whisk.system/pushnotifications` | package | appId, appSecret  | Work with the Push Service |
| `/whisk.system/pushnotifications/sendMessage` | action | text, url, deviceIds, platforms, userIds, tagNames, gcmCollapseKey, gcmCategory, gcmIcon, gcmDelayWhileIdle, gcmSync, gcmVisibility, gcmPayload, gcmPriority, gcmSound, gcmTimeToLive, gcmStyleType, gcmStyleTitle, gcmStyleUrl, gcmStyleText, gcmStyleLines, gcmLightsLedArgb, gcmLightsLedOnMs, gcmLightsLedOffMs, apnsBadge, apnsCategory, apnsIosActionKey, apnsPayload, apnsType, apnsSound, apnsTitleLocKey, apnsLocKey, apnsLaunchImage, apnsTitleLocArgs, apnsLocArgs, apnstitle, apnsSubtitle, apnsAttachmentUrl, fireFoxTitle, fireFoxIconUrl, fireFoxTimeToLive, fireFoxPayload, safariTitle, safariUrlArgs, safariAction, chromeTitle, chromeIconUrl, chromeTimeToLive, chromePayload, chromeAppExtTitle, chromeAppExtCollapseKey, chromeAppExtDelayWhileIdle, chromeAppExtIconUrl, chromeAppExtTimeToLive, chromeAppExtPayload | Send push notification to one or more specified devices |
| `/whisk.system/pushnotifications/webhook` | feed | events | Fire trigger events on device activities (device registration, unregistration, subscription, or unsubscription) on the Push service |
Creating a package binding with the `appId` and `appSecret` values is suggested. This way, you don't need to specify these credentials every time you invoke the actions in the package.

## Creating a Push package binding
{: #openwhisk_catalog_pushnotifications_create}

To create a Push Notifications package binding, you must specify the following parameters,

-  `appId`: The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app GUID.
-  `appSecret`: The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} push notification service appSecret.

To create a package binding, see the following example steps:

1. Create an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application in the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard](http://console.bluemix.net).

2. Initialize the Push Notification Service and bind the service to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application

3. Configure the [Push Notification application](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/mobilepush/index.html).

  Be sure to remember the `App GUID` and the `App Secret` of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app you created.

4. Create a package binding with the `/whisk.system/pushnotifications`.

  ```
  wsk package bind /whisk.system/pushnotifications myPush -p appId myAppID -p appSecret myAppSecret
  ```
  {: pre}
  
5. Verify that the package binding exists.

  ```
  wsk package list
  ```
  {: pre}
  ```
  packages
  /myNamespace/myPush private binding
  ```

  ```
  wsk action invoke /myNamespace/myPush/sendMessage --blocking --result  -p url https://example.com -p text "this is my message"  -p sound soundFileName -p deviceIds "[\"T1\",\"T2\"]"
  ```
  {: pre}

  ```json
  {
    "result": {
    "pushResponse":
      {
        "messageId":"11111H",
        "message":{
          "alert":"this is my message",
          "url":""
        },
        "settings":{
          "apns":{
            "sound":"default"
          },
          "gcm":{
            "sound":"default"
            },

## Firing a Trigger event on Push Notifications service activity
{: #openwhisk_catalog_pushnotifications_fire}

The `/whisk.system/pushnotifications/webhook` configures the Push service to fire a Trigger when there is a device activity such as device registration / unregistration or subscription / unsubscription in a specified application

The parameters are as follows:

- `appId:` The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app GUID.
- `appSecret:` The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} push notification service appSecret.
- `events:` Supported events are `onDeviceRegister`, `onDeviceUnregister`, `onDeviceUpdate`, `onSubscribe`, and `onUnsubscribe`. You can use the wildcard character `*` to be notified for all events.

To create a trigger that is fired each time a new device registers with the Push Notifications service application, see the following example:

1. Create a package binding that is configured for your Push Notifications service with your appId and appSecret.
  ```
  wsk package bind /whisk.system/pushnotifications myNewDeviceFeed --param appID myapp --param appSecret myAppSecret --param events onDeviceRegister
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Create a trigger for the Push Notifications service `onDeviceRegister` event type by using your `myPush/webhook` feed.
  ```
  wsk trigger create myPushTrigger --feed myPush/webhook --param events onDeviceRegister
  ```
  {: pre}

3. You could create a rule that sends a message every time a new device gets register. Create a rule by using the previous action and trigger.
  ```
  wsk rule create --enable myRule myPushTrigger sendMessage
  ```
  {: pre}

  Check the results in the `wsk activation poll`.

  Register a device in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application. You can see the `Rule`, `Trigger`, and  `Action` are executed in the OpenWhisk [dashboard](https://console.{Domain}/openwhisk/dashboard).

  The Action sends a push notification.
